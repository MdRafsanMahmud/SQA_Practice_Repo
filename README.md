# SQA_Testing_Practice_Repo
This repository contains my SQA practice projects, including manual test case writing and bug reporting. Currently, it features test cases for a To-Do List application, with more testing projects to be added. It serves as a portfolio to showcase my software testing skills, covering test documentation, defect tracking, and QA best practices.
